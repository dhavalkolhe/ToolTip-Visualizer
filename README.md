# Tooltip App

Welcome to the repository for the Frontend Development Internship's tooltip app project. This project focuses on building a frontend application that renders dynamic tooltips with customizable positioning, style, and text. The app provides a real-time preview of the tooltips being rendered and is built using Next.js. The tooltip component is developed from scratch without the use of additional libraries.
